# The Effects of Robotics in Health and Social Care: Cloud Robotics AI for Medical Insights

Health and social care are two industrial sectors were technologies have always been pervasive in addressing the patients care of tomorrow. Indeed, stockholders in both sectors are increasingly investing resources in digital innovation, pushing for the adoption of disruptive paradigms, such as robotics, which is having a growing impact in health and social care through the provision of services for supporting physicians in making decisions. Moreover, unparalleled insights come out from robots when they operate with Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, keystone for taking full advantage from robotic AI applications is exploiting medical data.
However, even if the industries are awash in them, data are typically not organized well and provided in time.

In this thesis, we face on health and social care problems of two industrial use cases. On one side, the IRCCS Centro Neurolesi "Bonino Pulejo" (Messina, Italy) received from us support in building a clinical Cloud workflow for collecting, organizing and integrating health care data from gait training robotics equipment, and therefore turning them into an exploratory analysis with the purpose to identify therapies through an abnormal gait pattern recognition.
On the other side, we supported Humanizing Technologies GmbH (Vienna, Austria) in building a framework which enables the humanoid robot Pepper to act as in-house companion. A Cloud robotics AI solution provides conversation-oriented services to both keep going an open topic conversational agent and monitor run-time dialogs in terms of depression indicators.

These studies were developed more on identifying technical critical issues, where however we can highlight good results in terms of available methodologies and their performance. On the other hand, the collaboration between ICT and health/social care professionals is still work in progress. Bridging this gap could potentially becoming disruptive, as the way we build applications and systems today affects the direction in which our societies will further develop.
